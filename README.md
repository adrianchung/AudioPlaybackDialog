AudioPlaybackDialog
===================

This is some sample code for creating your own audio player dialog in Android.
It doesn't include a pause and resume button yet. 

To use it, update the file name in AudioPlaybackDialog, or edit the constructor
to accept a path to a file that you'd like to play. Next, instantiate it like
any other dialog. 

See MainActivity for an example of how you may wish to use it.
